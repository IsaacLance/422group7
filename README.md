Brew can be used to quickly install pyqt5.

## Running the tests
We have provided two tests to test the functionality of the calendar application.
To run, open the file with python using the following bash command:
```bash
$ python test_Model.py
```
test_model.py tests if a event shows up if the database is cleared, and then added. 
It asserts if the number of entries added is the correct number.
If it is incorrect it will show an error in the terminal. For details:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y512gUP_uNcVmjh-EibinXldxwDEUoGd5NDIIyF9q70/edit?usp=sharing



The second test, 
```bash
$ python test_model2.py
```
test_model2.py puts the application under more rigorous tests. 
Testing the order and type of arguments given to the application.
